# edge-segmentation of retinal layers

This project is fo edge detection of retinal layers using computer vision which is based on Sobel, Canny and Robert models.
Additionally U-net is used to make predictions on the different layers

For the Deep Learning alogorithm U-net model it is based on
[multiclass_segmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/Beknaizer/OCT-Retinal-Layer-Segmenter/blob/6cceeb5501893421f8dbb46764aeba2971c70f1a/simple_unet.py)


For anotation of dataset I used makesense.ai
